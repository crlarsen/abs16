# Compute absolute value of a 16-bit signed integer

## Description

The original version of the code uses a 16-bit prefix adder to compute the absolute value. The prefix adder
was generated by the Python script [padder.py](https://github.com/crlarsen/padder).

The code in this repository consists of a Verilog module to calculate the absolute value of a 16-bit signed
integer and a Verilog test bench module to confirm that as the 16-bit absolute value module evolves that no
bugs have been introduced. The evolving 16-bit absolute value module was generated using the Python script
[abs.py](https://github.com/crlarsen/abs). The repository for abs.py shows its evolution from the original
padder.py script to its present form as a script to generate Verilog code for the specific purpose of
generating absolute value modules for integer values of an arbitrary number of bits.

The code is explained in the video series [Building an FPU in Verilog](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlO9sSrh8HrwcDHAtwec1ycV-m50nfUVs).
